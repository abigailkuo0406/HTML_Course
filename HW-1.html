            28, 1999) is a Slovenian professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball
            Association (NBA). He also represents the Slovenian national team.<br>Born in Ljubljana, Dončić shone as a
            youth player for Union Olimpija before joining the youth academy of Real Madrid. In 2015 he made his debut
            for the academy's senior team at age 16, becoming the youngest in club history. He led Madrid to the 2018
            EuroLeague title, winning the EuroLeague MVP and the Final Four MVP. Dončić was named the ACB Most Valuable
            Player and won back-to-back EuroLeague Rising Star and ACB Best Young Player awards. In addition, he was
            selected to the EuroLeague 2010–20 All-Decade Team.<br>In 2018, Dončić declared for the NBA draft, joining
            the Dallas Mavericks.He was selected unanimously to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and won Rookie of the Year
            for the 2018–19 season. In his next three seasons, he was selected to the NBA All-Star game and named to the
            All-NBA First Team. He is the Mavericks' franchise leader in career triple-doubles.<br>Dončić made his
            senior debut for Slovenia in 2016 at only 17 years of age. He would later help his country win its first
            EuroBasket title in 2017 while also being named to the All-Tournament Team.</p>
        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>Dončić was born in Ljubljana to Mirjam Poterbin, an owner of beauty salons, and Saša Dončić, a basketball
            coach and former player.His mother is Slovenian, and his father is a Slovenian of Serbian descent from
            Kosovo.His parents filed for divorce in 2008, with custody and legal guardianship granted to his
            mother.<br>According to his family, Dončić first touched a basketball when he was seven months old and
            frequently played with a miniature hoop in his room by age one. He played various sports in his childhood,
            including football, which he later quit after growing too tall. At age seven, he began playing organized
            basketball at a primary school in Ljubljana.His opponents at the time were up to ten years old, as Dončić
            reflected: "I was always training and playing with older kids who had much more experience than me. Many of
            them were bigger and faster than me too, so I had to beat them with my brain." He admired Greek basketball
            player Vassilis Spanoulis from his early teenage years, stating that he was "enchanted" by him. He wore the
            number 7 at Real Madrid in honor of Spanoulis. Dončić also grew up admiring American basketball player
            LeBron James.</p>
        <h3>Youth career</h3>
        <h4>Union Olimpija</h4>
        <p>When Dončić was eight, his father started playing for his hometown club Union Olimpija. Olimpija Basketball
            School coach Grega Brezovec invited Luka to practice with players his age. Dončić was initially expected to
            practice with players his age. Still, only 16 minutes into his first training session, the coaching staff
            moved him to the 11-year-old group. Starting in the next session, he primarily practiced with Olimpija's
            under-14 team. Still, due to league rules, he only played for the club's under-12 selection team, coming off
            the bench against opponents three or four years older than him. Despite his exclusion from under-14 games at
            the time, Dončić often asked to attend practice, even when his coach asked him to stay home.<br>Representing
            Olimpija at the under-14 Vasas Intesa Sanpaolo Cup in Budapest in September 2011, Dončić was named the most
            valuable player (MVP) despite finishing as runners-up to FC Barcelona. In February 2012, he was loaned to
            Spanish club Real Madrid for the Minicopa Endesa, an under-14 Spanish club competition. Dončić averaged 13.0
            points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 3.3 steals per game to win tournament MVP honors, leading Real Madrid
            to a second-place finish. In April 2012, he participated in the under-13 Lido di Roma Tournament for
            Olimpija, finishing as MVP and leading scorer with 34.5 points per game. In the semi-final round of the
            event against Victoria Fermo, he posted 29 points and 15 rebounds. In a title-clinching win over Lazio, he
            erupted for 54 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.</p>
        <h4>Real Madrid</h4>
        <p>In September 2012, at 13 years of age, Dončić signed a five-year contract with Real Madrid, immediately
            standing out on the under-16 team with coach Paco Redondo. He moved to Madrid, living with football and
            basketball prospects. In February 2013, Dončić led Real Madrid to a Minicopa Endesa win, averaging 24.5
            points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, and 6 steals per game. In the tournament's final game, he contributed 25
            points, 16 rebounds, and 5 steals to defeat FC Barcelona and win MVP honors. In March, Dončić earned MVP
            accolades of the under-16 Spain Championship, scoring 25 points in a championship game win over the Gran
            Canaria youth team.<br> In the 2014–15 season, Dončić mainly played with Real Madrid's under-18 and reserve
            teams. He averaged 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 3.1 assists with the reserve team, helping them win Group
            B of the Liga EBA, the amateur fourth-division of Spanish basketball. By the end of the season, he earned
            all-league honorable mention accolades from the basketball website Eurobasket.com.In January 2015, Dončić
            won the under-18 Ciutat de L'Hospitalet Tournament and was selected to the All-Tournament Team, despite
            being two years younger than the rest of the team. On January 6, against the youth team of his former club
            Union Olimpija, he posted a double-double of 13 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, and 4 steals.In May 2015, he
            also won the under-18 Next Generation Tournament, for which he was selected MVP after helping defeat
            defending champions Crvena zvezda Belgrade in the final.</p>
