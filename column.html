        當你在負面人格與正面人格的心理測驗都獲得了很高的總分，這是合理的嗎？

        首先，你得先知道所謂的「心理測驗」是怎麼做出來的。

        一個心理測驗的誕生，源於心理學家對於某一個「心理構念」充滿好奇，需要透過測驗或量表的方式來探索此構念的意涵。在教育心理學上，最常被討論的構念，就是「智力」。以迦納的多元智能理論為例，在迦納的眼中，智力被分為八個向度(語文、邏輯與數學、自然觀察、空間、音樂、身體動覺、人際與內省智能)，因此多元智能測驗便會包含這八個向度的題目，來評估個人的智力程度。

        到這裡你一定會想問，人的智力一定包含這八個面向嗎？

        沒錯，智力的範疇究竟包含哪些面向，心理學家們有非常多的歧異，有些學者認為智力包含兩種因子、有人認為包含七種能力等。對於相同的一個名詞，在心理學上卻有非常多不同的解釋，而這正是所謂「構念」的意涵──被「建構」出來的概念。例如，為了解釋智力這一個抽象的概念，心理學者「建構」出智力應該包含的範疇，經由瞭解人們在各個小範疇的擅長程度，以綜合評估個人的智力表現。

        那麼，社交人格測驗的設計者，是如何建構「正面」人格與「負面」人格的呢？

        我們可以從測驗的結果當中發現，兩種人格都各自被劃分出六個向度。也就是說，設計這兩份測驗的人認為，「社交正面人格」由正直、樂觀、愛心、擔當、果敢與自律六面向構成，「社交負面人格」則由冷漠、多疑、算計、支配、偏執、誇張等構成。在這裡你可以發現一件事：兩種人格各自涵蓋的六個面向，彼此並不是相互對立的。例如，樂觀的反面應該是悲觀，然而在負面人格中並沒有包含此面向；或者，冷漠的反面應該是熱情，在正面人格當中也沒有包含這一項。因此，我們可以說，這兩份測驗所建構出來的「社交正面人格」與「社交負面人格」兩個概念，並不是彼此相對或相反的概念。

        那麼，回到我們最一開始的問題：當你在負面人格與正面人格的心理測驗都獲得了很高的總分，這是合理的嗎？

        是的，這是一個合理的結果。正如前面所說的，既然這兩份測驗建構出的正面人格與負面人格並非完全相反，也就代表你可以兼具這兩個構念各自所帶有的意涵。簡單來說，你可以是一個既誇張又偏執、卻也正直而自律的人(或既偏執冷漠又充滿擔當跟果敢，隨便你怎麼組成)。由於這些名詞背後的意涵彼此互不矛盾，如果有人同時具備了這12項人格特質，你也不必太意外。所以，如果是基於這兩份測驗的結果，你當然可以說，在社交人格上，你自己是一個「既正面又負面」的人囉！

        又或者如果你認為「正面人格」與「負面人格」必須是彼此相反的概念，那麼就編一份全新的測驗去「建構」你所認為的社交人格吧！

        <p>Luka Dončić(/ˈdɒntʃɪtʃ/ DON-chich; Slovene: [ˈlùːka ˈdòːntʃitʃ]; born February
            28, 1999) is a Slovenian professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball
            Association (NBA). He also represents the Slovenian national team.<br>Born in Ljubljana, Dončić shone as a
            youth player for Union Olimpija before joining the youth academy of Real Madrid. In 2015 he made his debut
            for the academy's senior team at age 16, becoming the youngest in club history. He led Madrid to the 2018
            EuroLeague title, winning the EuroLeague MVP and the Final Four MVP. Dončić was named the ACB Most Valuable
            Player and won back-to-back EuroLeague Rising Star and ACB Best Young Player awards. In addition, he was
            selected to the EuroLeague 2010–20 All-Decade Team.<br>In 2018, Dončić declared for the NBA draft, joining
            the Dallas Mavericks.He was selected unanimously to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and won Rookie of the Year
            for the 2018–19 season. In his next three seasons, he was selected to the NBA All-Star game and named to the
            All-NBA First Team. He is the Mavericks' franchise leader in career triple-doubles.<br>Dončić made his
            senior debut for Slovenia in 2016 at only 17 years of age. He would later help his country win its first
            EuroBasket title in 2017 while also being named to the All-Tournament Team.</p>
        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>Dončić was born in Ljubljana to Mirjam Poterbin, an owner of beauty salons, and Saša Dončić, a basketball
            coach and former player.His mother is Slovenian, and his father is a Slovenian of Serbian descent from
            Kosovo.His parents filed for divorce in 2008, with custody and legal guardianship granted to his
            mother.<br>According to his family, Dončić first touched a basketball when he was seven months old and
            frequently played with a miniature hoop in his room by age one. He played various sports in his childhood,
            including football, which he later quit after growing too tall. At age seven, he began playing organized
            basketball at a primary school in Ljubljana.His opponents at the time were up to ten years old, as Dončić
            reflected: "I was always training and playing with older kids who had much more experience than me. Many of
            them were bigger and faster than me too, so I had to beat them with my brain." He admired Greek basketball
            player Vassilis Spanoulis from his early teenage years, stating that he was "enchanted" by him. He wore the
            number 7 at Real Madrid in honor of Spanoulis. Dončić also grew up admiring American basketball player
            LeBron James.</p>
        <h3>Youth career</h3>
        <h4>Union Olimpija</h4>
        <p>When Dončić was eight, his father started playing for his hometown club Union Olimpija. Olimpija Basketball
            School coach Grega Brezovec invited Luka to practice with players his age. Dončić was initially expected to
            practice with players his age. Still, only 16 minutes into his first training session, the coaching staff
            moved him to the 11-year-old group. Starting in the next session, he primarily practiced with Olimpija's
            under-14 team. Still, due to league rules, he only played for the club's under-12 selection team, coming off
            the bench against opponents three or four years older than him. Despite his exclusion from under-14 games at
            the time, Dončić often asked to attend practice, even when his coach asked him to stay home.<br>Representing
            Olimpija at the under-14 Vasas Intesa Sanpaolo Cup in Budapest in September 2011, Dončić was named the most
            valuable player (MVP) despite finishing as runners-up to FC Barcelona. In February 2012, he was loaned to
            Spanish club Real Madrid for the Minicopa Endesa, an under-14 Spanish club competition. Dončić averaged 13.0
            points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 3.3 steals per game to win tournament MVP honors, leading Real Madrid
            to a second-place finish. In April 2012, he participated in the under-13 Lido di Roma Tournament for
            Olimpija, finishing as MVP and leading scorer with 34.5 points per game. In the semi-final round of the
            event against Victoria Fermo, he posted 29 points and 15 rebounds. In a title-clinching win over Lazio, he
            erupted for 54 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.</p>
        <h4>Real Madrid</h4>
        <p>In September 2012, at 13 years of age, Dončić signed a five-year contract with Real Madrid, immediately
            standing out on the under-16 team with coach Paco Redondo. He moved to Madrid, living with football and
            basketball prospects. In February 2013, Dončić led Real Madrid to a Minicopa Endesa win, averaging 24.5
            points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, and 6 steals per game. In the tournament's final game, he contributed 25
            points, 16 rebounds, and 5 steals to defeat FC Barcelona and win MVP honors. In March, Dončić earned MVP
            accolades of the under-16 Spain Championship, scoring 25 points in a championship game win over the Gran
            Canaria youth team.<br> In the 2014–15 season, Dončić mainly played with Real Madrid's under-18 and reserve
            teams. He averaged 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 3.1 assists with the reserve team, helping them win Group
            B of the Liga EBA, the amateur fourth-division of Spanish basketball. By the end of the season, he earned
            all-league honorable mention accolades from the basketball website Eurobasket.com.In January 2015, Dončić
            won the under-18 Ciutat de L'Hospitalet Tournament and was selected to the All-Tournament Team, despite
            being two years younger than the rest of the team. On January 6, against the youth team of his former club
            Union Olimpija, he posted a double-double of 13 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, and 4 steals.In May 2015, he
            also won the under-18 Next Generation Tournament, for which he was selected MVP after helping defeat
            defending champions Crvena zvezda Belgrade in the final.</p>
